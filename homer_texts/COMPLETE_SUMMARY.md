## Technical Details

### Validation Achievements
- All texts achieve 100% validation of Greek prosody rules
- Proper handling of:
  - Acute accents (must be highest pitch in word)
  - Circumflex accents (must descend)
  - Final acute accents (cannot rise after)
  
### Key Fixes Applied
1. **Word Boundary Detection**: Fixed to handle HTML files with and without "wordend" markers
2. **Accent Detection**: Properly identifies acute, circumflex, and final acute from Greek text
3. **Multi-Strategy Generation**: Uses 8 different melodic strategies to achieve both validation and pleasantness

### Output Files
For each book:
- `.tab` - Tabulature format with full prosody information
- `.ly` - LilyPond notation file
- `.pdf` - Musical score
- Individual MIDI files for each line
- Concatenated MIDI file for the complete book

## Musical Characteristics
- **Time Signature**: 4/4
- **Note Duration Ratio**: Exact 1:2 (short:long)
- **Scale**: Ancient Dorian (Modern E Phrygian) (E F G A B C D)
- **Average Pleasantness**: ~0.69-0.70 across all books
